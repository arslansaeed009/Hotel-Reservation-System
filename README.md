# Hotel-Reservation-System
A console-based Hotel Reservation System developed in C++ that manages room bookings, check-ins, and check-outs. This application allows users to manage hotel room reservations and provides basic functionalities to handle customer interactions and room availability.
## Features
- **Add Room: Add new rooms to the hotel.**
- **Display Rooms: View all available rooms.**
- **Make Reservation: Reserve a room for a customer.**
- **Check-In: Check-in a customer who has a reservation.**
- **Check-Out: Check-out a customer and make the room available again.**
- **View Reservations: Display all current reservations.**
  ## Technologies Used
- **C++: The project is developed using the C++ programming language.**
  ## Getting Started
  ## Prerequisites
- **A C++ compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC).**
- **A development environment (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any IDE of your choice).**
  ## Installation
  1. Clone the Repository:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-reservation-system.git
  2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
      ```sh
      cd hotel-reservation-system
  3. Compile the Source Code:
       ```sh
       g++ hotel_reservation_system.cpp -o hotel_reservation_system
  4. Run the Executable:
     ```sh
     ./hotel_reservation_system
      ```
     ## Usage
 - **Start the program and follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.**
 - **Select an option from the menu to add rooms, display rooms, make reservations, check in or out customers, and view reservations.**
   ## How It Works
 - **Room Management:** Allows adding new rooms and viewing available rooms.
 - **Reservations:** Facilitates room reservations with customer details and dates.
 - **Check-In/Check-Out:** Manages the check-in and check-out processes, updating room availability.
 - **Viewing Reservations:** Shows all active reservations with room numbers and customer information.
 ## Limitations
- **Data is stored in memory and is lost when the program exits.**
- **Limited to a maximum of 100 rooms and reservations.**
  ## Future Enhancements
 - **Implement data persistence using file handling to save room and reservation details.**
 - **Add advanced room availability checking by date.**
 - **Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.**
